                <h4>My visit to Hawai'i included a layover on the Big Island</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Lucky for me, I had a whole day to explore the Volcano National Park in July of 2021. While there I
                    was able to see the most active volcano in the world, sleeping of course! Just my luck!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Kīlauea, also known as Halemaʻumaʻu, was sleeping for about a year. The caldera had collapsed in on
                    itself with the lava that drained from the volcano. I did take several pictures, the one you can see
                    above you can make out a little bit of steam rising on the far left side of the caldera walls. </p>
                <br>
                <p>And wouldn't you have guessed, about 3 months since I was there the volcano began erupting once again
                    and continues to this day. The crater you see above is now filling with an active lava lake. And as
                    of the writting of this blog, it looks to be going strong.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b><i>Latest update from USGS (June 24, 2022):</i></b></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><b>Halemaʻumaʻu Lava Lake Observations:</b> Eruption of lava from the Halemaʻumaʻu
                        western vent into the active lava lake, and ooze-outs onto the crater floor, have continued over
                        the past 24 hours. Lava ooze-out activity has continued along the eastern and southern edges of
                        the crater floor. Overflight measurements on June 17, 2022, indicated that the crater floor had
                        seen a total rise of about 120 meters (394 feet) and that 93 million cubic meters (24 billion
                        gallons) of lava had been effused since the beginning of this eruption on September 29, 2021.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I am planning to go back to Hawai'i, but I think I'll wait to get a flight for when it's more active,
                    preferably with a lava fountain. When that happens, I'll post an update to my blog.</p>
